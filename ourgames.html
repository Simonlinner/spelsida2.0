                        In this game, you'll play against the computer in ten rounds of Rock Paper Scissors.
                        Here's how it works: Rock beats Scissors,
                        Scissors beats Paper,
                        Paper beats Rock.
                        After each round, you'll see the result and the current score.
                        Let's see if you can beat the computer!

                        In this game, you have to guess a secret number between 1 and 100.
                        After each guess, you'll be told if the secret number is higher or
                        lower than your guess again. Keep guessing until you find the correct number!
                        Once you guess the correct number, you'll see how many tries it took you to get it right.
